fix
	In the currency converter, conversion rates were not displayed in the decimal format of the country (eg, in France, the point was used as decimal separator).
	In the "Account statements" tab, the optional sort order of "Debt" and "Receipt" columns was alphabetical instead of numerical. 
	Bugs introduced in 0.11.2:<ul><li>Opening a file protected by password, then clicking on "Cancel" in the password dialog, resulted in an error.</li><li>Reading a file that contained no transactions resulted in an error.</li><li>Under Linux, wait dialogs were systematically and briefly displayed in the corner of the screen while reading or writing data or while accessing the Internet</li></ul>

version	0.11.2 (05/28/2012)
improvement
	The csv exports doesn't contain anymore thousands separators (Excel doesn't recognize strings with such separators as numbers).
fix
	In countries where space is the thousand separator (France, Sweden, ...), amounts including a space as thousand separator were rejected during import (This was due to a <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4510618">java bug</a>).

fix
	When editing of subtransaction, clicking the check box "receipt" when the "amount" was empty caused an error.
	Double-click on a some lists (for example in the transactions table) with the crtl key down could caused an error, or leave the edit/delete button enabled when no lines were selected in the list.

version	0.9.11 (01/25/2012)

	When generating periodic operations, the end date of operations whose frequency was expressed in days was ignored.

version	0.9.10 (01/09/2012)
improvement
	When an operation pointed is duplicated, the statement is emptied (unless the autofill function is set in the preferences dialog. In such a case, this field is automatically filed).

version	0.9.8 (12/18/2011)
improvement
	When creating mass transactions the date is now kept when you click the next button.
fix
	Some imported file separators (eg \) were not supported. Using such a separator led to a crash of the import file dialog.
	Using account names, method of payment or categories that begin or end with spaces could cause crashes in the dialog for creating these objects.
	The icons and warning messages (when the threshold of balance is exceeded or when there are periodic transactions to generate) were sometimes displayed on the wrong tab.
	When selecting a shortcut (symbolic link) in a file selection dialog, Yapbam did not follow the link to read/save the target file, but directly read/saved the shortcut file.

version	0.9.7 (11/13/2011)
improvement
	It is now possible to display relative balances in the transactions tab (you have to click a balance to make it the reference for other balances).

improvement

fix
	The export crashed when "comment" was in the exported fields.
	Closing Yapbam under Java 1.7:  didn't exit the java virtual machine process.

version	0.9.3 (09/25/2011)
fix
	In countries where the thousands separator is the point (Belgium, for example), when entering an amount without a currency unit (eg 5,25), this number was transformed into a different number (eg 525,00&nbsp;&euro;).
	In "Statements" tab: When opening multiple accounts while running Yapbam, editing transactions resulted in the appearance of the edit dialog of the transaction several times.

version	0.9.2 (09/18/2011)
fix
	Since the 0.9.0 version, when Yapbam was configured to remember the filter and the opened file between two launches, and Yapbam is closed with a password protected file opened, Yapbam was unable to start again. The only way to restart Yabam was to erase the line starting with "filter" in Data/.yapbam file.<br/> In order to fix this major problem as fast as possible, and as it is caused by a misconception of the filter backup, the filter backup is deactivated in this release when using password protected file.
	In importation: When the imported file contained invalid lines and the last column of the file wasn't attached to a transaction attribute, the importation failed.

version	0.9.1 (09/16/2011)
fix
	Exportation was impossible if a previous exportation has been made in a previous Yapbam version.

	When, in the transaction input dialog, you chose a predefined label with the date field empty, the error dialog signaled a program error.
	The mode creation dialog allowed the user to check the "use a checkbook" box then to uncheck the "Usable for expenses" box. Validating such a dialog caused an error.
	In the subtransaction edition dialog: When you chose a description in the popup menu by clicking on it with the mouse, the description appeared in the field (this is the normal behavior). But, when validating the input, the description saved was the one before selecting the predefined description !
	Entering an invalid regular expression in the "custom filter" dialog caused an error when validating the dialog.

	In the administration tab:<ul><li>"Delete", "Duplicate" and "Edit" buttons were not grayed out when no data was selected. Sometimes it could cause crashes.</li><li>Deleting the content of the "initial balance" cell of an account in the accounts table caused a crash.</li></ul>
	In transaction dialog, checking the receipt box when amount field was empty caused a crash.
	In the "customized filters" dialog: The "Clear all filters" button didn't erase the filter based on the receipt/expense nature of the transaction.

fix
